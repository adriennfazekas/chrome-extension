With this extension you can save any link or datas and use them any time.

To the input field you can copy the datas, after that click to the save input button and you get a list like at the picture above.
Another way to save the links is the save tab button. With that you can save the actual window's link. 

When you close the window and open again the saved datas still will be there.
