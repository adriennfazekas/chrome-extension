With this extension you can save any link or data and use them any time.

To the input field you can copy any notes, after that click the save input button and you get a list the one like at the picture above.
Another way to save the links is the save tab button. With that you can save the active tab's link. 

When you close the browser and open it later the saved data still will be available.
